# Health_Monitoring_Dashboard

Applications for MHealth (Mobile Health) and E-Health (Healthcare assisted by ICT) enable many ordinary people to improve, support, and aid their health. This paper offers another online platform for periodically checking on a person's health metrics. This gives doctors and other medical professionals the chance to monitor a patient's health using variables like body temperature, blood pressure, etc. Additionally, these data (the parameter readings) can be retrieved and stored. One's information is recorded upon registering (creating an account) on the website, and health measurements are tracked as and when the user logs in, delivering a personalised medical history. The website also has a function that allows users to periodically update their profile information, such as their height, weight, and age. The Arduino IDE, ESP8266, sensors, Arduino Uno, Django Python Web Framework, HTML, and CSS were used to construct the project.

In the domain of health monitoring, the Internet of Thing (IOT) is widely regarded as one of the most practical technologies for remote value tracking. This paper developed an IoT based health monitoring system using different sensors. Various sensors were used to monitor body temperature, oxygen level, humidity, air quality index and temperature of surrounding.These all values are sent to ThingSpeak and then with the help of API keys these health parameters were displayed on a user-friendly website.
